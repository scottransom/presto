.SH OPTIONS
.IP -noxwin
Do not show the result plots on-screen, only make postscript files.
.IP -showfold
Use the input fold paramters (i.e. not the optimized values) when showing the plot.
.IP -scaleparts
Scale the part profiles independently.
.IP -allgrey
Make all the images greyscale instead of color.
.IP -justprofs
Only output the profile portions of the plot.
.IP -portrait
Orient the output in portrait mode (for -justprofs).
.IP -events
The folded data were events instead of samples or bins.
.IP -infoonly
Display the pfd info and exit without generating plots..
.IP -fixchi
Adjust the reduced chi^2 values so that off-pulse reduced chi^2 = 1.
.IP -samples
Treat the data as samples and not as finite-duration integrated data.
.IP -killsubs
Comma separated string (no spaces!) of subbands to explicitly remove from analysis (i.e. zero out).  Ranges are specified by min:max[:step],
.br
1 String value
.IP -killparts
Comma separated string (no spaces!) of intervals to explicitly remove from analysis (i.e. zero-out).  Ranges are specified by min:max[:step],
.br
1 String value
.IP infile
The input 'pfd' file name..

.\" cligPart DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page was generated automagically by clig, the
Command Line Interface Generator. Actually the programmer
using clig was supposed to edit this part of the manual
page after
generating it with clig, but obviously (s)he didn't.

Sadly enough clig does not yet have the power to pick a good
program description out of blue air ;-(
