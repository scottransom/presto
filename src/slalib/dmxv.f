      SUBROUTINE sla_DMXV (DM, VA, VB)
*+
*     - - - - -
*      D M X V
*     - - - - -
*
*  Performs the 3-D forward unitary transformation:
*
*     vector VB = matrix DM * vector VA
*
*  (double precision)
*
*  Given:
*     DM       dp(3,3)    matrix
*     VA       dp(3)      vector
*
*  Returned:
*     VB       dp(3)      result vector
*
*  To comply with the ANSI Fortran 77 standard, VA and VB must be
*  different arrays.  However, the routine is coded so as to work
*  properly on many platforms even if this rule is violated.
