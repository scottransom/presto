                                 DESCRIPTION

 MPFIT uses the Levenberg-Marquardt technique to solve the
 least-squares problem.  In its typical use, MPFIT will be used to
 fit a user-supplied function (the "model") to user-supplied data
 points (the "data") by adjusting a set of parameters.  MPFIT is
 based upon MINPACK-1 (LMDIF.F) by More' and collaborators.

 For example, a researcher may think that a set of observed data
 points is best modelled with a Gaussian curve.  A Gaussian curve is
 parameterized by its mean, standard deviation and normalization.
 MPFIT will, within certain constraints, find the set of parameters
 which best fits the data.  The fit is "best" in the least-squares
 sense; that is, the sum of the weighted squared differences between
 the model and data is minimized.

 The Levenberg-Marquardt technique is a particular strategy for
 iteratively searching for the best fit.  This particular
 implementation is drawn from MINPACK-1 (see NETLIB), and is much faster
 and more accurate than the version provided in the Scientific Python package
 in Scientific.Functions.LeastSquares.
 This version allows upper and lower bounding constraints to be placed on each
 parameter, or the parameter can be held fixed.

 The user-supplied Python function should return an array of weighted
 deviations between model and data.  In a typical scientific problem
 the residuals should be weighted so that each deviate has a
 gaussian sigma of 1.0.  If X represents values of the independent
 variable, Y represents a measurement for each value of X, and ERR
 represents the error in the measurements, then the deviates could
 be calculated as follows:

   DEVIATES = (Y - F(X)) / ERR

 where F is the analytical function representing the model.  You are
 recommended to use the convenience functions MPFITFUN and
 MPFITEXPR, which are driver functions that calculate the deviates
 for you.  If ERR are the 1-sigma uncertainties in Y, then

   TOTAL( DEVIATES^2 ) 

 will be the total chi-squared value.  MPFIT will minimize the
 chi-square value.  The values of X, Y and ERR are passed through
 MPFIT to the user-supplied function via the FUNCTKW keyword.

 Simple constraints can be placed on parameter values by using the
 PARINFO keyword to MPFIT.  See below for a description of this
 keyword.

 MPFIT does not perform more general optimization tasks.  See TNMIN
 instead.  MPFIT is customized, based on MINPACK-1, to the
 least-squares minimization problem.


                               USER FUNCTION

 The user must define a function which returns the appropriate
 values as specified above.  The function should return the weighted
 deviations between the model and the data.  It should also return a status
 flag and an optional partial derivative array.  For applications which
 use finite-difference derivatives -- the default -- the user
 function should be declared in the following way:

   def myfunct(p, fjac=None, x=None, y=None, err=None)
    # Parameter values are passed in "p"
    # If fjac==None then partial derivatives should not be
    # computed.  It will always be None if MPFIT is called with default
    # flag.
    model = F(x, p)
    # Non-negative status value means MPFIT should continue, negative means
    # stop the calculation.
    status = 0
    return([status, (y-model)/err]

 See below for applications with analytical derivatives.

 The keyword parameters X, Y, and ERR in the example above are
 suggestive but not required.  Any parameters can be passed to
 MYFUNCT by using the functkw keyword to MPFIT.  Use MPFITFUN and
 MPFITEXPR if you need ideas on how to do that.  The function *must*
 accept a parameter list, P.

 In general there are no restrictions on the number of dimensions in
 X, Y or ERR.  However the deviates *must* be returned in a
 one-dimensional numpy array of type float.

 User functions may also indicate a fatal error condition using the
 status return described above. If status is set to a number between
 -15 and -1 then MPFIT will stop the calculation and return to the caller.


                            ANALYTIC DERIVATIVES

 In the search for the best-fit solution, MPFIT by default
 calculates derivatives numerically via a finite difference
 approximation.  The user-supplied function need not calculate the
 derivatives explicitly.  However, if you desire to compute them
 analytically, then the AUTODERIVATIVE=0 keyword must be passed to MPFIT.
 As a practical matter, it is often sufficient and even faster to allow
 MPFIT to calculate the derivatives numerically, and so
 AUTODERIVATIVE=0 is not necessary.

 If AUTODERIVATIVE=0 is used then the user function must check the parameter
 FJAC, and if FJAC!=None then return the partial derivative array in the
 return list.
   def myfunct(p, fjac=None, x=None, y=None, err=None)
    # Parameter values are passed in "p"
    # If FJAC!=None then partial derivatives must be comptuer.
    # FJAC contains an array of len(p), where each entry
    # is 1 if that parameter is free and 0 if it is fixed. 
    model = F(x, p)
    Non-negative status value means MPFIT should continue, negative means
    # stop the calculation.
    status = 0
    if (dojac):
       pderiv = numpy.zeros([len(x), len(p)], numpy.float)
       for j in range(len(p)):
         pderiv[:,j] = FGRAD(x, p, j)
    else:
       pderiv = None
    return([status, (y-model)/err, pderiv]

 where FGRAD(x, p, i) is a user function which must compute the
 derivative of the model with respect to parameter P[i] at X.  When
 finite differencing is used for computing derivatives (ie, when
 AUTODERIVATIVE=1), or when MPFIT needs only the errors but not the
 derivatives the parameter FJAC=None.  

 Derivatives should be returned in the PDERIV array. PDERIV should be an m x
 n array, where m is the number of data points and n is the number
 of parameters.  dp[i,j] is the derivative at the ith point with
 respect to the jth parameter.  

 The derivatives with respect to fixed parameters are ignored; zero
 is an appropriate value to insert for those derivatives.  Upon
 input to the user function, FJAC is set to a vector with the same
 length as P, with a value of 1 for a parameter which is free, and a
 value of zero for a parameter which is fixed (and hence no
 derivative needs to be calculated).

 If the data is higher than one dimensional, then the *last*
 dimension should be the parameter dimension.  Example: fitting a
 50x50 image, "dp" should be 50x50xNPAR.


           CONSTRAINING PARAMETER VALUES WITH THE PARINFO KEYWORD

 The behavior of MPFIT can be modified with respect to each
 parameter to be fitted.  A parameter value can be fixed; simple
 boundary constraints can be imposed; limitations on the parameter
 changes can be imposed; properties of the automatic derivative can
 be modified; and parameters can be tied to one another.

 These properties are governed by the PARINFO structure, which is
 passed as a keyword parameter to MPFIT.

 PARINFO should be a list of dictionaries, one list entry for each parameter.
 Each parameter is associated with one element of the array, in
 numerical order.  The dictionary can have the following keys
 (none are required, keys are case insensitive):

    'value' - the starting parameter value (but see the START_PARAMS
             parameter for more information).

    'fixed' - a boolean value, whether the parameter is to be held
             fixed or not.  Fixed parameters are not varied by
             MPFIT, but are passed on to MYFUNCT for evaluation.

    'limited' - a two-element boolean array.  If the first/second
               element is set, then the parameter is bounded on the
               lower/upper side.  A parameter can be bounded on both
               sides.  Both LIMITED and LIMITS must be given
               together.

    'limits' - a two-element float array.  Gives the
              parameter limits on the lower and upper sides,
              respectively.  Zero, one or two of these values can be
              set, depending on the values of LIMITED.  Both LIMITED
              and LIMITS must be given together.

    'parname' - a string, giving the name of the parameter.  The
               fitting code of MPFIT does not use this tag in any
               way.  However, the default iterfunct will print the
               parameter name if available.

    'step' - the step size to be used in calculating the numerical
            derivatives.  If set to zero, then the step size is
            computed automatically.  Ignored when AUTODERIVATIVE=0.

    'mpside' - the sidedness of the finite difference when computing
              numerical derivatives.  This field can take four
              values:

                 0 - one-sided derivative computed automatically
                 1 - one-sided derivative (f(x+h) - f(x)  )/h
                -1 - one-sided derivative (f(x)   - f(x-h))/h
                 2 - two-sided derivative (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2*h)

             Where H is the STEP parameter described above.  The
             "automatic" one-sided derivative method will chose a
             direction for the finite difference which does not
             violate any constraints.  The other methods do not
             perform this check.  The two-sided method is in
             principle more precise, but requires twice as many
             function evaluations.  Default: 0.

    'mpmaxstep' - the maximum change to be made in the parameter
                 value.  During the fitting process, the parameter
                 will never be changed by more than this value in
                 one iteration.

                 A value of 0 indicates no maximum.  Default: 0.

    'tied' - a string expression which "ties" the parameter to other
            free or fixed parameters.  Any expression involving
            constants and the parameter array P are permitted.
            Example: if parameter 2 is always to be twice parameter
            1 then use the following: parinfo(2).tied = '2 * p(1)'.
            Since they are totally constrained, tied parameters are
            considered to be fixed; no errors are computed for them.
            [ NOTE: the PARNAME can't be used in expressions. ]

    'mpprint' - if set to 1, then the default iterfunct will print the
               parameter value.  If set to 0, the parameter value
               will not be printed.  This tag can be used to
               selectively print only a few parameter values out of
               many.  Default: 1 (all parameters printed)


 Future modifications to the PARINFO structure, if any, will involve
 adding dictionary tags beginning with the two letters "MP".
 Therefore programmers are urged to avoid using tags starting with
 the same letters; otherwise they are free to include their own
 fields within the PARINFO structure, and they will be ignored.

 PARINFO Example:
 parinfo = [{'value':0., 'fixed':0, 'limited':[0,0], 'limits':[0.,0.]}]*5
 parinfo[0]['fixed'] = 1
 parinfo[4]['limited'][0] = 1
 parinfo[4]['limits'][0]  = 50.
 values = [5.7, 2.2, 500., 1.5, 2000.]
 for i in range(5): parinfo[i]['value']=values[i]

 A total of 5 parameters, with starting values of 5.7,
 2.2, 500, 1.5, and 2000 are given.  The first parameter
 is fixed at a value of 5.7, and the last parameter is
 constrained to be above 50.


                                   EXAMPLE

   import mpfit
   import numpy
   x = numpy.arange(100, numpy.float)
   p0 = [5.7, 2.2, 500., 1.5, 2000.]
   y = ( p[0] + p[1]*[x] + p[2]*[x**2] + p[3]*numpy.sqrt(x) +
         p[4]*numpy.log(x))
   fa = {'x':x, 'y':y, 'err':err}
   m = mpfit('myfunct', p0, functkw=fa)
   print 'status = ', m.status
   if (m.status <= 0): print 'error message = ', m.errmsg
   print 'parameters = ', m.params

   Minimizes sum of squares of MYFUNCT.  MYFUNCT is called with the X,
   Y, and ERR keyword parameters that are given by FUNCTKW.  The
   results can be obtained from the returned object m.


                            THEORY OF OPERATION

   There are many specific strategies for function minimization.  One
   very popular technique is to use function gradient information to
   realize the local structure of the function.  Near a local minimum
   the function value can be taylor expanded about x0 as follows:

      f(x) = f(x0) + f'(x0) . (x-x0) + (1/2) (x-x0) . f''(x0) . (x-x0)
             -----   ---------------   -------------------------------  (1)
     Order    0th          1st                      2nd

   Here f'(x) is the gradient vector of f at x, and f''(x) is the
   Hessian matrix of second derivatives of f at x.  The vector x is
   the set of function parameters, not the measured data vector.  One
   can find the minimum of f, f(xm) using Newton's method, and
   arrives at the following linear equation:

      f''(x0) . (xm-x0) = - f'(x0)                            (2)

   If an inverse can be found for f''(x0) then one can solve for
   (xm-x0), the step vector from the current position x0 to the new
   projected minimum.  Here the problem has been linearized (ie, the
   gradient information is known to first order).  f''(x0) is
   symmetric n x n matrix, and should be positive definite.

   The Levenberg - Marquardt technique is a variation on this theme.
   It adds an additional diagonal term to the equation which may aid the
   convergence properties:

      (f''(x0) + nu I) . (xm-x0) = -f'(x0)                  (2a)

   where I is the identity matrix.  When nu is large, the overall
   matrix is diagonally dominant, and the iterations follow steepest
   descent.  When nu is small, the iterations are quadratically
   convergent.

   In principle, if f''(x0) and f'(x0) are known then xm-x0 can be
   determined.  However the Hessian matrix is often difficult or
   impossible to compute.  The gradient f'(x0) may be easier to
   compute, if even by finite difference techniques.  So-called
   quasi-Newton techniques attempt to successively estimate f''(x0)
   by building up gradient information as the iterations proceed.

   In the least squares problem there are further simplifications
   which assist in solving eqn (2).  The function to be minimized is
   a sum of squares:

       f = Sum(hi^2)                                         (3)

   where hi is the ith residual out of m residuals as described
   above.  This can be substituted back into eqn (2) after computing
   the derivatives:

       f'  = 2 Sum(hi  hi')     
       f'' = 2 Sum(hi' hj') + 2 Sum(hi hi'')                (4)

   If one assumes that the parameters are already close enough to a
   minimum, then one typically finds that the second term in f'' is
   negligible [or, in any case, is too difficult to compute].  Thus,
   equation (2) can be solved, at least approximately, using only
   gradient information.

   In matrix notation, the combination of eqns (2) and (4) becomes:

        hT' . h' . dx = - hT' . h                          (5)

   Where h is the residual vector (length m), hT is its transpose, h'
   is the Jacobian matrix (dimensions n x m), and dx is (xm-x0).  The
   user function supplies the residual vector h, and in some cases h'
   when it is not found by finite differences (see MPFIT_FDJAC2,
   which finds h and hT').  Even if dx is not the best absolute step
   to take, it does provide a good estimate of the best *direction*,
   so often a line minimization will occur along the dx vector
   direction.

   The method of solution employed by MINPACK is to form the Q . R
   factorization of h', where Q is an orthogonal matrix such that QT .
   Q = I, and R is upper right triangular.  Using h' = Q . R and the
   ortogonality of Q, eqn (5) becomes

        (RT . QT) . (Q . R) . dx = - (RT . QT) . h
                     RT . R . dx = - RT . QT . h         (6)
                          R . dx = - QT . h

   where the last statement follows because R is upper triangular.
   Here, R, QT and h are known so this is a matter of solving for dx.
   The routine MPFIT_QRFAC provides the QR factorization of h, with
   pivoting, and MPFIT_QRSOLV provides the solution for dx.

#
#     the purpose of lmdif is to minimize the sum of the squares of
#     m nonlinear functions in n variables by a modification of
#     the levenberg-marquardt algorithm. the user must provide a
#     subroutine which calculates the functions. the jacobian is
#     then calculated by a forward-difference approximation.
#
#     the subroutine statement is
#
#       subroutine lmdif(fcn,m,n,x,fvec,ftol,xtol,gtol,maxfev,epsfcn,
#                        diag,mode,factor,nprint,info,nfev,fjac,
#                        ldfjac,ipvt,qtf,wa1,wa2,wa3,wa4)
#
#     where
#
#       fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
#         calculates the functions. fcn must be declared
#         in an external statement in the user calling
#         program, and should be written as follows.
#
#         subroutine fcn(m,n,x,fvec,iflag)
#         integer m,n,iflag
#         double precision x(n),fvec(m)
#         ----------
#         calculate the functions at x and
#         return this vector in fvec.
#         ----------
#         return
#         end
#
#         the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless
#         the user wants to terminate execution of lmdif.
#         in this case set iflag to a negative integer.
#
#       m is a positive integer input variable set to the number
#         of functions.
#
#       n is a positive integer input variable set to the number
#         of variables. n must not exceed m.
#
#       x is an array of length n. on input x must contain
#         an initial estimate of the solution vector. on output x
#         contains the final estimate of the solution vector.
#
#       fvec is an output array of length m which contains
#         the functions evaluated at the output x.
#
#       ftol is a nonnegative input variable. termination
#         occurs when both the actual and predicted relative
#         reductions in the sum of squares are at most ftol.
#         therefore, ftol measures the relative error desired
#         in the sum of squares.
#
#       xtol is a nonnegative input variable. termination
#         occurs when the relative error between two consecutive
#         iterates is at most xtol. therefore, xtol measures the
#         relative error desired in the approximate solution.
#
#       gtol is a nonnegative input variable. termination
#         occurs when the cosine of the angle between fvec and
#         any column of the jacobian is at most gtol in absolute
#         value. therefore, gtol measures the orthogonality
#         desired between the function vector and the columns
#         of the jacobian.
#
#       maxfev is a positive integer input variable. termination
#         occurs when the number of calls to fcn is at least
#         maxfev by the end of an iteration.
#
#       epsfcn is an input variable used in determining a suitable
#         step length for the forward-difference approximation. this
#         approximation assumes that the relative errors in the
#         functions are of the order of epsfcn. if epsfcn is less
#         than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative
#         errors in the functions are of the order of the machine
#         precision.
#
#       diag is an array of length n. if mode = 1 (see
#         below), diag is internally set. if mode = 2, diag
#         must contain positive entries that serve as
#         multiplicative scale factors for the variables.
#
#       mode is an integer input variable. if mode = 1, the
#         variables will be scaled internally. if mode = 2,
#         the scaling is specified by the input diag. other
#         values of mode are equivalent to mode = 1.
#
#       factor is a positive input variable used in determining the
#         initial step bound. this bound is set to the product of
#         factor and the euclidean norm of diag*x if nonzero, or else
#         to factor itself. in most cases factor should lie in the
#         interval (.1,100.). 100. is a generally recommended value.
#
#       nprint is an integer input variable that enables controlled
#         printing of iterates if it is positive. in this case,
#         fcn is called with iflag = 0 at the beginning of the first
#         iteration and every nprint iterations thereafter and
#         immediately prior to return, with x and fvec available
#         for printing. if nprint is not positive, no special calls
#         of fcn with iflag = 0 are made.
#
#       info is an integer output variable. if the user has
#         terminated execution, info is set to the (negative)
#         value of iflag. see description of fcn. otherwise,
#         info is set as follows.
#
#         info = 0  improper input parameters.
#
#         info = 1  both actual and predicted relative reductions
#                   in the sum of squares are at most ftol.
#
#         info = 2  relative error between two consecutive iterates

class mpfit(object):
   def __init__(self, fcn, xall=None, functkw={}, parinfo=None,
                ftol=1.e-10, xtol=1.e-10, gtol=1.e-10,
                damp=0., maxiter=200, factor=100., nprint=1,
                iterfunct='default', iterkw={}, nocovar=0,
                fastnorm=0, rescale=0, autoderivative=1, quiet=0,
                diag=None, epsfcn=None, debug=0):
      """
Inputs:
  fcn:
     The function to be minimized.  The function should return the weighted
     deviations between the model and the data, as described above.

  xall:
     An array of starting values for each of the parameters of the model.
     The number of parameters should be fewer than the number of measurements.

     This parameter is optional if the parinfo keyword is used (but see
     parinfo).  The parinfo keyword provides a mechanism to fix or constrain
     individual parameters.  

Keywords:

   autoderivative:
      If this is set, derivatives of the function will be computed
      automatically via a finite differencing procedure.  If not set, then
      fcn must provide the (analytical) derivatives.
         Default: set (=1) 
         NOTE: to supply your own analytical derivatives,
               explicitly pass autoderivative=0

   fastnorm:
      Set this keyword to select a faster algorithm to compute sum-of-square
      values internally.  For systems with large numbers of data points, the
      standard algorithm can become prohibitively slow because it cannot be
      vectorized well.  By setting this keyword, MPFIT will run faster, but
      it will be more prone to floating point overflows and underflows.  Thus, setting
      this keyword may sacrifice some stability in the fitting process.
         Default: clear (=0)

   ftol:
      A nonnegative input variable. Termination occurs when both the actual
      and predicted relative reductions in the sum of squares are at most
      ftol (and status is accordingly set to 1 or 3).  Therefore, ftol
      measures the relative error desired in the sum of squares.
         Default: 1E-10

   functkw:
      A dictionary which contains the parameters to be passed to the
      user-supplied function specified by fcn via the standard Python
      keyword dictionary mechanism.  This is the way you can pass additional
      data to your user-supplied function without using global variables.

      Consider the following example:
         if functkw = {'xval':[1.,2.,3.], 'yval':[1.,4.,9.],
                       'errval':[1.,1.,1.] }
      then the user supplied function should be declared like this:
         def myfunct(p, fjac=None, xval=None, yval=None, errval=None):

      Default: {}   No extra parameters are passed to the user-supplied
                    function. 

   gtol:
      A nonnegative input variable. Termination occurs when the cosine of
      the angle between fvec and any column of the jacobian is at most gtol
      in absolute value (and status is accordingly set to 4). Therefore,
      gtol measures the orthogonality desired between the function vector
      and the columns of the jacobian.
         Default: 1e-10

   iterkw:
      The keyword arguments to be passed to iterfunct via the dictionary
      keyword mechanism.  This should be a dictionary and is similar in
      operation to FUNCTKW.
         Default: {}  No arguments are passed.

   iterfunct:
      The name of a function to be called upon each NPRINT iteration of the
      MPFIT routine.  It should be declared in the following way:
         def iterfunct(myfunct, p, iter, fnorm, functkw=None, 
                       parinfo=None, quiet=0, dof=None, [iterkw keywords here])
         # perform custom iteration update

      iterfunct must accept all three keyword parameters (FUNCTKW, PARINFO
      and QUIET). 

      myfunct:  The user-supplied function to be minimized,
      p:        The current set of model parameters
      iter:     The iteration number
      functkw:  The arguments to be passed to myfunct.
      fnorm:    The chi-squared value.
      quiet:    Set when no textual output should be printed.
      dof:      The number of degrees of freedom, normally the number of points
                less the number of free parameters.
      See below for documentation of parinfo.

      In implementation, iterfunct can perform updates to the terminal or
      graphical user interface, to provide feedback while the fit proceeds.
      If the fit is to be stopped for any reason, then iterfunct should return a
      a status value between -15 and -1.  Otherwise it should return None
      (e.g. no return statement) or 0.
      In principle, iterfunct should probably not modify the parameter values,
      because it may interfere with the algorithm's stability.  In practice it
      is allowed.

      Default: an internal routine is used to print the parameter values.

      Set iterfunct=None if there is no user-defined routine and you don't
      want the internal default routine be called.

   maxiter:
      The maximum number of iterations to perform.  If the number is exceeded,
      then the status value is set to 5 and MPFIT returns.
      Default: 200 iterations

   nocovar:
      Set this keyword to prevent the calculation of the covariance matrix
      before returning (see COVAR)
      Default: clear (=0)  The covariance matrix is returned

   nprint:
      The frequency with which iterfunct is called.  A value of 1 indicates
      that iterfunct is called with every iteration, while 2 indicates every
      other iteration, etc.  Note that several Levenberg-Marquardt attempts
      can be made in a single iteration.
      Default value: 1

   parinfo
      Provides a mechanism for more sophisticated constraints to be placed on
      parameter values.  When parinfo is not passed, then it is assumed that
      all parameters are free and unconstrained.  Values in parinfo are never
      modified during a call to MPFIT.

      See description above for the structure of PARINFO.

      Default value: None  All parameters are free and unconstrained.

   quiet:
      Set this keyword when no textual output should be printed by MPFIT

   damp:
      A scalar number, indicating the cut-off value of residuals where
      "damping" will occur.  Residuals with magnitudes greater than this
      number will be replaced by their hyperbolic tangent.  This partially
      mitigates the so-called large residual problem inherent in
      least-squares solvers (as for the test problem CURVI,
      http://www.maxthis.com/curviex.htm).
      A value of 0 indicates no damping.
         Default: 0

      Note: DAMP doesn't work with autoderivative=0

   xtol:
      A nonnegative input variable. Termination occurs when the relative error
      between two consecutive iterates is at most xtol (and status is
      accordingly set to 2 or 3).  Therefore, xtol measures the relative error
      desired in the approximate solution.
      Default: 1E-10

 Outputs:

   Returns an object of type mpfit.  The results are attributes of this class,
   e.g. mpfit.status, mpfit.errmsg, mpfit.params, npfit.niter, mpfit.covar.

   .status
      An integer status code is returned.  All values greater than zero can
      represent success (however .status == 5 may indicate failure to
      converge). It can have one of the following values:

      -16
         A parameter or function value has become infinite or an undefined
         number.  This is usually a consequence of numerical overflow in the
         user's model function, which must be avoided.

      -15 to -1 
         These are error codes that either MYFUNCT or iterfunct may return to
         terminate the fitting process.  Values from -15 to -1 are reserved
         for the user functions and will not clash with MPFIT.

      0  Improper input parameters.

      1  Both actual and predicted relative reductions in the sum of squares
         are at most ftol.

      2  Relative error between two consecutive iterates is at most xtol

      3  Conditions for status = 1 and status = 2 both hold.

      4  The cosine of the angle between fvec and any column of the jacobian
         is at most gtol in absolute value.

      5  The maximum number of iterations has been reached.

      6  ftol is too small. No further reduction in the sum of squares is
         possible.

      7  xtol is too small. No further improvement in the approximate solution
         x is possible.

      8  gtol is too small. fvec is orthogonal to the columns of the jacobian
         to machine precision.

   .fnorm
      The value of the summed squared residuals for the returned parameter
      values.

   .covar
      The covariance matrix for the set of parameters returned by MPFIT.
      The matrix is NxN where N is the number of  parameters.  The square root
      of the diagonal elements gives the formal 1-sigma statistical errors on
      the parameters if errors were treated "properly" in fcn.
      Parameter errors are also returned in .perror.

      To compute the correlation matrix, pcor, use this example:
         cov = mpfit.covar
         pcor = cov * 0.
         for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
               pcor[i,j] = cov[i,j]/numpy.sqrt(cov[i,i]*cov[j,j])

      If nocovar is set or MPFIT terminated abnormally, then .covar is set to
      a scalar with value None.

   .errmsg
      A string error or warning message is returned.

   .nfev
      The number of calls to MYFUNCT performed.

   .niter
      The number of iterations completed.

   .perror
      The formal 1-sigma errors in each parameter, computed from the
      covariance matrix.  If a parameter is held fixed, or if it touches a
      boundary, then the error is reported as zero.

      If the fit is unweighted (i.e. no errors were given, or the weights
      were uniformly set to unity), then .perror will probably not represent
      the true parameter uncertainties.  

      *If* you can assume that the true reduced chi-squared value is unity --
      meaning that the fit is implicitly assumed to be of good quality --
      then the estimated parameter uncertainties can be computed by scaling
      .perror by the measured chi-squared value.

         dof = len(x) - len(mpfit.params) # deg of freedom
         # scaled uncertainties
         pcerror = mpfit.perror * numpy.sqrt(mpfit.fnorm / dof)

   #     matrix q, a permutation matrix p, and an upper trapezoidal
   #     matrix r with diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude,
   #     such that a*p = q*r. the householder transformation for
   #     column k, k = 1,2,...,min(m,n), is of the form
   #
   #                        t
   #        i - (1/u(k))*u*u
   #
   #     where u has zeros in the first k-1 positions. the form of
   #     this transformation and the method of pivoting first
   #     appeared in the corresponding linpack subroutine.
   #
   #     the subroutine statement is
   #
   #    subroutine qrfac(m,n,a,lda,pivot,ipvt,lipvt,rdiag,acnorm,wa)

   #
   #    a is an m by n array. on input a contains the matrix for

   #      the strict upper trapezoidal part of a contains the strict
   #      upper trapezoidal part of r, and the lower trapezoidal
   #      part of a contains a factored form of q (the non-trivial
   #      elements of the u vectors described above).
   #
   #    lda is a positive integer input variable not less than m
   #      which specifies the leading dimension of the array a.
   #
   #    pivot is a logical input variable. if pivot is set true,

   #      then no column pivoting is done.

   #    ipvt is an integer output array of length lipvt. ipvt
   #      defines the permutation matrix p such that a*p = q*r.

   #    r(lindgen(n)*(m+1)) = rdiag
   #
   # Next, Q, which are composed from the reflectors.  Each reflector v
   # is taken from the upper trapezoid of aa, and converted to a matrix
   # via (I - 2 vT . v / (v . vT)).
   #
   #   hh = ident                                    ## identity matrix
   #   for i = 0, n-1 do begin
   #    v = aa(*,i) & if i GT 0 then v(0:i-1) = 0    ## extract reflector
   #    hh = hh ## (ident - 2*(v # v)/total(v * v))  ## generate matrix

   #     subroutine lmpar
   #
   #     given an m by n matrix a, an n by n nonsingular diagonal
   #     matrix d, an m-vector b, and a positive number delta,
   #     the problem is to determine a value for the parameter
   #     par such that if x solves the system
   #
   #        a*x = b ,     sqrt(par)*d*x = 0 ,
   #
   #     in the least squares sense, and dxnorm is the euclidean
   #     norm of d*x, then either par is zero and
   #
   #        (dxnorm-delta) .le. 0.1*delta ,
   #
   #     or par is positive and
   #
   #        abs(dxnorm-delta) .le. 0.1*delta .
   #
   #     this subroutine completes the solution of the problem
   #     if it is provided with the necessary information from the
   #     qr factorization, with column pivoting, of a. that is, if
   #     a*p = q*r, where p is a permutation matrix, q has orthogonal
   #     columns, and r is an upper triangular matrix with diagonal
   #     elements of nonincreasing magnitude, then lmpar expects
   #     the full upper triangle of r, the permutation matrix p,
   #     and the first n components of (q transpose)*b. on output
   #     lmpar also provides an upper triangular matrix s such that

   #        p *(a *a + par*d*d)*p = s *s .
   #
   #     s is employed within lmpar and may be of separate interest.
   #
   #     only a few iterations are generally needed for convergence
   #     of the algorithm. if, however, the limit of 10 iterations
   #     is reached, then the output par will contain the best

   #      (transposed) of the upper triangular matrix s.

   #      is column ipvt(j) of the identity matrix.

   #    diag is an input array of length n which must contain the
   #      diagonal elements of the matrix d.

   #    qtb is an input array of length n which must contain the first
   #      n elements of the vector (q transpose)*b.

   #    delta is a positive input variable which specifies an upper
   #      bound on the euclidean norm of d*x.
